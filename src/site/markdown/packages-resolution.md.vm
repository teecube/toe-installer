$h2 Automatic packages resolution

${toeDisplayedName} - ${toeDisplayedInstallerName} has a state-of-the-art
system to resolve the required <em>TIBCO installation packages</em>.
It can retrieve the installation packages from a local directory with a
zero-configuration approach or from a Maven repository (local or remote).

<div class="well" style="padding-top: 12px;">
	<h4><span class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></span> What is a TIBCO installation
package ?</h4> 

A TIBCO installation package is a zipped file containing a TIBCO product to be
installed and its installation program. For instance:<br/>
<blockquote style="margin: 15px;"><em>TIB_</em><span class="color-highlight"><strong>BW</strong></span>_<strong>6.4.0</strong><span>_</span><em>win_x86_64</em><u>.zip</u></blockquote>
is the installation package for TIBCO
<span class="color-highlight"><strong>B</strong></span>usiness
<span class="color-highlight"><strong>W</strong></span>orks
version <strong>6.4.0</strong>
for <em>Win</em>dows platform <span>(<em>x86_64</em> architecture)</span>.
<br />
Notice that these installation packages filenames are always prefixed by
<em>TIB_</em> and suffixed by the <u>.zip</u> file extension, that they contain
a short name of the product, the version and the system/architecture.

$h3 Local

Local resolution looks for TIBCO installation packages in a filesystem directory
based on the official naming convention.
The default location is the current directory where this Maven plugin is run
(${basedir}).

$h3 Remote

Remote resolution is based on Maven dependency mechanism. It requires that
the TIBCO installation packages are available in a Maven repository. It does not
matter whether the Maven repository is remote or local even though this
resolution method is called remote as opposed as local resolution which is based
on simple local directories only.
